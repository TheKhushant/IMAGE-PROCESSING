type in command window 
a = 1 (enter)
b = 2
(in right hadn workspace we can see it)
c = a + b
(c becomes 3)


use to get cube of all matrix elements
a.^3 

concanitation of array horizontally (, = horizontally increase, & ';' for vertically incresing)
A = [a,a]   = here 'A' is concinated array and 'a' is original array

to enlarge vertically:
B = [a; a]
___________________________________________________
      MAGIC = (redimate / inbuilt function)

A*magic(4)
this is automacally create a 4 * 4 matrix

A(4,2)
we can retrive specific element
