open -> mathlab -> tutorials -> desktop basics >

type in command window 
a = 1 (enter)
b = 2
(in right hadn workspace we can see it)
c = a + b
(c becomes 3)


use to get cube of all matrix elements
a.^3 

concanitation of array horizontally (, = horizontally increase, & ';' for vertically incresing)
A = [a,a]   = here 'A' is concinated array and 'a' is original array

to enlarge vertically:
B = [a; a]
___________________________________________________
      MAGIC = (redimate / inbuilt function)

A*magic(4)
this is automacally create a 4 * 4 matrix

A(4,2)
we can retrive specific element

create a fifth coloum in forth row, 
A(4,5) = 17

To refere to specifc element
A(1:3, 2)                  ----> second row ki 3no details agayi

A = 0:10:100  -----> 10 - 10 ke difference me data print hojayega
